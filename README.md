# Wordpair Generator

A new Flutter project built following Brad Traversy [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gDhl4leEzA).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies from `pubspec.yaml` by running `flutter packages get` from the project root (see [using packages documentation](https://flutter.io/using-packages/#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app) for details and how to do this in the editor).

There you go, you can now open & edit the project. Enjoy!
